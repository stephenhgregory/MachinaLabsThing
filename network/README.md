This repository contains a solution to a simple problem, specified as follows.

Create two processes, known as "Process A" and "Process B". Then, using some communication protocol, pass an .stl file (3D CAD design description) from Process A to Process B. Process B will then return the contents of that .stl file back to Process A. Success in solving this problem is incumbent on equivalence between the original .stl file and newly saved .stl file.
